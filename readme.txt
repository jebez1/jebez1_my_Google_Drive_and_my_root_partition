Since https://support.google.com/drive/thread/407864048/feature-request-google-drive-public-folder-indexed-by-search-engines : still nothing, I created this readme.txt to index by search engines some of my interesting files in my Google Drive.

My Google Drive public folders:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pDoa4qb-WOcLY8uI9ZB7fmRL5LICQZqE read-only
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OrEDS67-HjGR639jPtA4afzIFOchlxT5 writable folder.

So in the 1st link there are:

how-tos folder with in:
Install Arch Linux by a script.txt
Create a shortcut launching Konsole with command(s).txt (This can be useful to e.g. upgrade, install, uninstall...)
Display a web page video at its native resolution.txt
How-tos about MIDI & SCVA.txt (Roland Sound Canvas VA, The default Windows MIDI soundfont on Arch Linux, yabridge using Proton instead of Wine, Carla, Play a .mid file, Play a video game MIDI, The latest SCVA 1.16)

math/dynamic physics with in:
the F∝ma proof
numerical: orbit Sun & Earth.txt
etc

Also the / partition of my PC (when it's on, not always):
ftp://[2a01:e0a:c5:b900:44fc:7bfe:e44a:661f]
to write in the file manager bar
read-only except /run/media/a/1637320b-b0c7-4f87-8b85-b635dee9595d/writable_folder
by FileZilla Server.

My username are also:
